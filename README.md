## Inspiration

We recognized the critical importance of reliability and safety in the development of autonomous systems like those of John Deere. **To embody these ideals, our aim was to create a robot capable of following a set trajectory while also being adept at obstacle avoidance, mirroring the real-world challenges faced in the field.**

## What It Does

The Lego Line Taxi autonomously follows a path marked by electrical tape, adjusting its course as needed at specific intervals. It is equipped to detect and navigate around obstacles, ensuring safety and efficiency in reaching its destination.

## How We Built It

The project integrates a state machine architecture for software, allowing seamless transitions between tasks. Physically, the robot includes three additional mounts for enhanced sensing and navigation, secured and assembled with a variety of components and some creative engineering.

- **Software:** Utilizes color filtering for path recognition and ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection, coupled with continuous tuning of parameters for optimal performance.
- **Hardware:** Features a robust design with extra mounts for a camera and sensors, emphasizing functionality and adaptability.

## Challenges We Ran Into

We encountered hardware limitations, such as damaged components, and software calibration issues. Fine-tuning for various environmental conditions proved time-consuming, highlighting the intricacies of real-world robotics applications.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of

Our successful implementation of line following and obstacle avoidance algorithms surpassed our expectations. The project served as a valuable introduction to computer vision and hardware-software integration in robotics.

## What We Learned

This experience broadened our understanding of robotics, from sensor integration to software engineering and physical design. It emphasized the value of resilience and innovation in overcoming technical challenges.

## What's Next for The Lego Line Taxi

Future enhancements include upgrading sensory capabilities, implementing advanced navigation algorithms, and exploring applications such as plant health monitoring. Our journey continues towards creating more sophisticated and reliable autonomous robotic systems.
